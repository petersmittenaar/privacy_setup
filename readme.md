# My privacy setup
#### or how to stop paying for services with your personal data

Much has been said about companies harvesting our personal data, whether that's really so bad, whether it's even possible to avoid it without reverting to browsing through plain text on a Tor network. Whatever the answer to those questions, it started feeling increasingly _dirty_ knowing that every single thing I did on these ad-supported networks was being tracked. I don't want tech companies reading my emails and tracking my every button click for the same visceral reason I don't want to pay my rent by allowing my landlord to install cameras in every room. 

With that in mind, what follows is a personal list of desperately half-baked ways of avoiding some surveillance that I can refer friends to when needed. Whether these tools successfully avoid tracking or not, it feels good to support these whacky business models of charging for a good product.

- Email, contacts, calendar: FastMail (I've found you need these 3 services in 1 provider. I used protonmail but lacking calendar is frustrating)
  - Fastmail has a great mobile app, but it can't automatically keep your contacts in sync. This is simple to do, install CardDAV and set it up, [it takes 5 minutes only](https://fastmail.blog/2015/08/21/carddav-your-contacts-everywhere-you-need-them/).
- Maps: OpenStreetMap (sadly search is crap and lacks many things, but fine for about 50% of things)
- Browser: Firefox (and Firefox Focus on mobile)
- Password management: KeePass
- Web search: duckduckgo (use the bangs for quickly searching any website, e.g. `!pm einstein` to search pubmed for "Einstein")
- Academic search: Semantic Scholar, Pubmed (Sci-Hub to find full papers)
- Online spreadsheets: Airtable 
- Notes: OutOfMilk or FastMail Notes
- File syncing: Dropbox (not ideal, I know)
- Online document editing: not tried any alternative to google docs, but I try to use dropbox + LibreOffice
- Desktop OS: Ubuntu 18.04 (+ occassional boot into Windows for things like Endnote and Word if needed for client)
- Mobile OS: LineageOS (this was not trivial to install though the guides were good)
- 2-step authenticator: Authy (does backups! Critical)
- DNS: Cloudflare
- Chat: Signal/WhatsApp (I know, I know. LineageOS privacy guard can prevent Whatsapp from sending all your contacts to Zuckerberg)
- VPN: Private Internet Access
- Social networks: don't bother

I have to admit I fall back on Google products when necessary (google maps in particular), though less and less often. 

My to-do list for switching is, in order of priority:
- Photos (Google Photos)
- Video streaming to projector (Chromecast)
- Online videos (Youtube)
- Smart assistant at home (currently none)
